# Hi, I'm Taylor Sanchez (Gabatino)!

I'm a Software Engineer and Consultant that's passionate about engineering and software. I'm currently working on a few personal projects, and updating this GitHub with a couple of my previous projects, along with those that are currently in production. 

I have many interests when it comes to tech! However, I specialize in Full Stack Web Development, DevOps, and Cloud Software and Security. 

Some of my personal projects and endeavors; however, are more rooted in video game/VR/AR development as they tie to the natural sciences, data science, and front and back-end development. 

I hope you enjor your stay!
